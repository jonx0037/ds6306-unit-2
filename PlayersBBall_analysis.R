# Introduction

In this analysis, I explore two datasets while implementing carefully chosen dark themes for each visualization. I've selected specific themes based on each visualization type to enhance readability and analytical clarity. Here's my rationale for the theme selections:

-   For statistical displays like bar charts and time series, I chose the Economist dark theme because its professional styling emphasizes data patterns.
-   For distribution plots (box plots and violin plots), I opted for the Solarized dark theme as its excellent contrast helps distinguish subtle variations.
-   For complex multi-variable plots like scatter plots, I implemented the minimal dark theme to reduce visual noise and focus on the data.
-   For modern visualization types, I used the modern dark theme to maintain a contemporary aesthetic.

## NBA Players Analysis

First, let's load and examine the PlayersBBall dataset:

```{r load-data}
# Read the NBA players dataset
players_data <- read.csv("PlayersBBall.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Display the structure of the data
str(players_data)

# Show the first few rows
head(players_data)
```

### Position Distribution Analysis

For this bar chart showing player position counts, I chose the Economist dark theme because it excels at presenting categorical comparisons:

```{r position-distribution}
# Create a position distribution plot
position_plot <- players_data %>%
  count(position) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(position, n), y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of NBA Players by Position",
    x = "Position",
    y = "Number of Players"
  ) +
  create_minimal_dark() +
  scale_fill_dark_qualitative()

# Make the plot interactive
ggplotly(position_plot)
```

The visualization of "Distribution of NBA Players by Position” demonstrates that Guards (G) and Forwards (F) have consistently been the most prevalent positions, highlighting the versatility and strategic importance of these roles in basketball. Centers (C), though less common, represent a specialized role that requires distinct physical attributes. Hybrid positions like Forward-Guard (F-G) and Forward-Center (F-C) are rarer but showcase the growing demand for versatile players who can adapt to multiple roles. This distribution emphasizes the changing dynamics of team composition and player specialization in the NBA. 

### Weight Distribution Analysis

For comparing weight distributions, I implemented the Solarized dark theme as it provides optimal contrast for distinguishing boxplot components:

```{r weight-distribution}
# Create box plots for weight comparison
weight_plot <- players_data %>%
  filter(position %in% c("C", "F")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = position, y = weight, fill = position)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(
    title = "Weight Distribution: Centers vs Forwards",
    x = "Position",
    y = "Weight (lbs)"
  ) +
  theme_solarized(light = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_solarized()

make_dark_plotly(weight_plot)

# Add statistical summary
players_data %>%
  filter(position %in% c("C", "F")) %>%
  group_by(position) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE),
    median_weight = median(weight, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_weight = sd(weight, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

The analysis of “Weight Distribution: Centers vs. Forwards” reveals that Centers (C) typically weigh significantly more than Forwards (F), with their distribution shifted towards higher values. Centers show a narrower interquartile range, indicating a more uniform weight distribution, likely due to the physical demands of their role in the paint. Forwards exhibit a broader weight distribution, reflecting the diversity in play styles and responsibilities associated with the position. The presence of outliers in both distributions highlights players who may thrive despite having atypical physical characteristics for their role. These insights underscore the importance of weight in defining player roles in basketball. 

### Height Distribution Analysis 

For this scatter plot showing the relationship between height and weight, I selected the minimal dark theme to emphasize the data points and trend lines: 

```{r height-distribution}
# Function to convert height strings to inches
convert_height_to_inches <- function(height_str) {
  parts <- strsplit(height_str, "-")[[1]]
  feet <- as.numeric(parts[1])
  inches <- as.numeric(parts[2])
  return(feet * 12 + inches)
}

# Add height in inches column
players_data$height_inches <- sapply(players_data$height, convert_height_to_inches)

# Create height distribution plot
height_plot <- players_data %>%
  filter(position %in% c("C", "F")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = position, y = height_inches, fill = position)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(
    title = "Height Distribution: Centers vs Forwards",
    x = "Position",
    y = "Height (inches)"
  ) +
theme_solarized(light = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_solarized()

ggplotly(height_plot)

# Add statistical summary
players_data %>%
  filter(position %in% c("C", "F")) %>%
  group_by(position) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_height = mean(height_inches, na.rm = TRUE),
    median_height = median(height_inches, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_height = sd(height_inches, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

The height analysis of “Height Distribution: Centers vs Forwards” indicates that Centers (C) generally have greater heights compared to Forwards (F), with their distributions showing minimal overlap. The median height for Centers is clearly higher, and the interquartile range is narrower, suggesting a more consistent height requirement for this position. Forwards, on the other hand, present a wider range of heights, reflecting more flexibility in height for their role. Outliers in both distributions imply that exceptional players can thrive outside the typical height ranges for their position. These insights underscore the importance of height in defining player roles in basketball.  

### Height Across All Positions

Let's examine height distributions across all positions:

```{r all-positions-height}
# Create violin plots for all positions
all_positions_plot <- ggplot(players_data, 
       aes(x = position, y = height_inches, fill = position)) +
  geom_violin() +
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.2, fill = "white", alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(
    title = "Height Distribution Across All Positions",
    x = "Position",
    y = "Height (inches)"
  ) +
  create_solarized_dark() +
  scale_fill_dark_qualitative()

ggplotly(all_positions_plot)
```

The “Height Distribution Across All Positions” visualization shows that Centers (C) consistently have the tallest heights, with a narrower distribution that reflects a more uniform height requirement for their role. Forwards (F) exhibit a broader range, allowing players to balance height with agility. Guards (G) are the shortest on average, with the most compact distribution, highlighting the necessity for speed and maneuverability in their position. Hybrid positions, such as Forward-Center (F-C), display overlapping ranges with their respective parent positions, emphasizing their versatility. These distributions highlight how height serves as a crucial factor in the specialization of basketball roles. 

### Height-Weight Relationship

Let's explore how height and weight are related:

```{r height-weight-relationship}
# Create a cleaned dataset for analysis
hw_clean <- players_data %>%
  # Remove rows with empty positions
  filter(position != "") %>%
  # Make sure height conversion worked and weight is valid
  filter(!is.na(height_inches), !is.na(weight)) %>%
  # Remove any extreme outliers that might be data errors
  filter(weight > 100, weight < 400) %>%  # reasonable weight range for basketball players
  filter(height_inches > 65, height_inches < 90)  # reasonable height range (5'5" to 7'6")

# Create a scatter plot with trend lines for each position
hw_plot <- ggplot(hw_clean, 
       aes(x = height_inches, y = weight, color = position)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(
    title = "Height vs Weight Relationship by Position",
    x = "Height (inches)",
    y = "Weight (lbs)",
    color = "Position"
  ) +
theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#1a1a1a"),
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#1a1a1a"),
    text = element_text(color = "white"),
    axis.text = element_text(color = "white"),
    panel.grid = element_line(color = "#333333")
  )

ggplotly(hw_plot)

# Calculate correlations by position with clean data
hw_clean %>%
  group_by(position) %>%
  summarise(
    correlation = cor(height_inches, weight, use = "complete.obs"),
    n = n()  # Add count to see sample size for each position
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(correlation))
```

The relationship between height and weight shown in “Height vs Weight Relationship by Position” illustrates a positive correlation, as expected—taller players generally weigh more. Centers (C) exhibit the steepest slope, indicating that as height increases, weight rises more significantly in this position, reflecting the physical demands of their role. Guards (G), on the other hand, show a flatter trend, consistent with their agility-focused role. Forwards (F) and hybrid positions (e.g., F-G) fall in between, suggesting a balance between height and weight demands. These trends highlight the physical specialization required for each position in professional basketball. 

### Historical Height Trends 

Let's investigate how player heights have changed over time:

```{r height-trends}
# Calculate average height by year
height_trend_plot <- players_data %>%
  group_by(year_start) %>%
  summarise(
    avg_height = mean(height_inches, na.rm = TRUE),
    se_height = sd(height_inches, na.rm = TRUE) / sqrt(n())
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year_start, y = avg_height)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = avg_height - se_height, 
                  ymax = avg_height + se_height),
              alpha = 0.2) +
  labs(
    title = "Average Player Height Over Time",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Average Height (inches)"
  ) +
  create_solarized_dark() +
  scale_fill_dark_qualitative()

ggplotly(height_trend_plot)
```

In “Average Player Height Over Time,” the historical trend demonstrates a clear increase in average player height from the 1950s to the late 1990s, reflecting changes in player selection criteria and the evolving physical demands of the sport. After 2000, the trend seems to plateau, indicating that the average player height has stabilized. This stabilization might be due to limits in the height of the talent pool or shifts in team strategies that prioritize versatility over sheer height. The ribbon around the trend line represents the standard error, showing the uncertainty in the average height estimate for each year. This analysis provides valuable insights into the historical trends in player height and the factors influencing these changes over time. 

## 3D Visualization: Height, Weight, and Year

Let's create a 3D visualization of height, weight, and year:

```{r 3d-visualization}
# Create 3D scatter plot using plotly with dark theme
plot_ly(players_data, 
        x = ~year_start, 
        y = ~height_inches, 
        z = ~weight,
        color = ~position,
        type = "scatter3d",
        mode = "markers",
        marker = list(size = 3)) %>%
  layout(
    title = list(
      text = "3D View: Height, Weight, and Year by Position",
      font = list(color = "#e0e0e0")
    ),
    paper_bgcolor = "#1a1a1a",  # Background color outside the plot
    plot_bgcolor = "#1a1a1a",   # Background color of the plot
    scene = list(
      xaxis = list(
        title = "Year",
        gridcolor = "#333333",
        zerolinecolor = "#333333",
        showbackground = TRUE,
        backgroundcolor = "#1a1a1a",
        titlefont = list(color = "#e0e0e0"),
        tickfont = list(color = "#e0e0e0")
      ),
      yaxis = list(
        title = "Height (inches)",
        gridcolor = "#333333",
        zerolinecolor = "#333333",
        showbackground = TRUE,
        backgroundcolor = "#1a1a1a",
        titlefont = list(color = "#e0e0e0"),
        tickfont = list(color = "#e0e0e0")
      ),
      zaxis = list(
        title = "Weight (lbs)",
        gridcolor = "#333333",
        zerolinecolor = "#333333",
        showbackground = TRUE,
        backgroundcolor = "#1a1a1a",
        titlefont = list(color = "#e0e0e0"),
        tickfont = list(color = "#e0e0e0")
      )
    )
  )
```

The 3D visualization, “3D View: Height, Weight, and Year by Position,” reveals distinct clusters of player positions based on height and weight. Centers (C) tend to cluster at higher weights and heights, reflecting the physical demands of their role. Guards (G) appear at the lower end of the spectrum for both variables, highlighting their agility-focused requirements. Over the years, the plot indicates a gradual increase in the height and weight of players, signaling an evolution toward larger, more physically dominant athletes across all positions. The interactive nature of the plot allows for a dynamic exploration of the data, enabling users to rotate and zoom in on specific data points for deeper insights.

## Education and Income Analysis

Now let's analyze the Education_Income dataset:

```{r load-education-data}
# Read the education and income dataset
education_data <- read.csv("Education_Income.csv")

# Create box plots of income by education level with improved formatting
income_plot <- ggplot(education_data, aes(x = Educ, y = Income2005)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "steelblue", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(
    title = "Income Distribution by Education Level",
    x = "Education Level",
    y = "Income (2005 USD)"
  ) +
  theme_solarized(light = FALSE) +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
    axis.text.y = element_text(hjust = 1)
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    labels = scales::dollar_format(scale = 1),
    breaks = seq(0, max(education_data$Income2005, na.rm = TRUE), by = 25000)
  ) +
  scale_fill_solarized()

# Convert to interactive plot
ggplotly(income_plot)

# Calculate summary statistics
education_data %>%
  group_by(Educ) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_income = mean(Income2005, na.rm = TRUE),
    median_income = median(Income2005, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_income = sd(Income2005, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

The analysis of income and education level in “Income Distribution by Education Level” shows that higher education levels correspond to higher median and mean incomes, highlighting the economic benefits of advanced education. However, as demonstrated by the interquartile ranges and outliers, income variability increases at higher education levels, indicating that while education generally boosts income, the returns may vary significantly among individuals with advanced degrees. The box plots provide a clear comparison of income distributions across different education levels, emphasizing the positive relationship between education and income. The summary statistics offer quantitative insights into the income distribution by education level, providing a comprehensive overview of the data.
